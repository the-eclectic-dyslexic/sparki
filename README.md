# Sparki

Sparki is a virtual watch dog who is more than happy to look after your battery while your Android device charges. He wants to help you stave off degredation of the lithium ion battery in your android device.

When your device reaches the charge that you designate, Sparki will get to work and sound the alarm, send a notification, and/or if you prefer he can send an HTTP GET request (possibly to a smart plug your device is plugged into to turn it off)

Sparki will not allow you to set a hard charge limit to your device's battery, as that requires root access in android, and Sparki wants you to be able to still run apps that don't like running on rooted devices.

Currently, Sparki only supports Android devices that are version 8.0 and later... and not all features have been tested on version 12 or later, due to not having access to hardware to test on.

Sparki is licensed under GPLv3, feel free to teach him some new tricks. This old dog is quite receptive to it. Pull requests and bug reports highly appreciated.
