    <string name="battery_optimizer_explanation">Sometimes Sparki will be prevented from running in the background by your device. If you are having trouble, either with Sparki not reminding you when the battery is charged or Sparki not properly starting when you reboot your device, first take a look at the battery optimizer and make sure Sparki is not being optimized.\n\n<i>Don\'t worry too much about the battery life impact; Sparki doesn\'t work too hard and when he does it\'s almost exclusively while the battery is charging.</i></string>
    <string name="permission_explainer">Unfortunately, Sparki can\'t know which WiFi network your device is on without location permissions being granted, so he can ask android. The poor old boy\'s eyesight isn\'t very good, and unfortunately can\'t see you have put him down beside the same plug you always do. If you withhold location permissions only entries with an empty <b>SSID</b> entry will work.\n\nDon\'t worry though, Sparki doesn\'t collect any of your data (location or otherwise). You, or anyone else, can confirm that for yourselves, as Sparki\'s code is open source and <a href="https://github.com/the-eclectic-dyslexic/sparki">available on GitHub</a>.</string>
